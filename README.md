# Sunset Skate Club - E-commerce

**Sunset Skate Club** is an e-commerce site built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Vite**. The project provides an online shopping experience for skate products, though it currently uses a generic product API (FakeStoreAPI). Future updates will introduce real skateboard products and more features.

## Features

- **Product Display**: Displays products fetched from **FakeStoreAPI**. Currently, the API doesn't include skate-specific products.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive for all devices using **TailwindCSS**.
- **Reusable Components**: Modular architecture with reusable React components for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Shopping Cart**: Cart management.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Simple and smooth navigation with **React Router**.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for better code quality and maintainability.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs quickly.
- **Vite**: Modern and fast build tool for web development.
- **FakeStoreAPI**: API providing generic product data (currently no skateboard-related products).

## API

The project currently uses **FakeStoreAPI** to fetch product data. Unfortunately, the API does not provide specific skate-related products at this time. In future updates, we aim to replace this API or integrate a custom solution that will allow us to offer skateboard-specific products to better suit the theme of Sunset Skate Club.

## Roadmap

- **Real Skateboard Products**: Replacing the current generic product data with actual skateboarding gear.
- **User Authentication**: Introducing user accounts, allowing customers to register, log in, and track orders.
- **Product Reviews & Ratings**: Allowing users to leave reviews and ratings for products they have purchased.

## Acknowledgments

- **FakeStoreAPI** for providing the product data.
- **TailwindCSS** for their flexible and powerful design framework.
- **Vite** for offering a fast and efficient development environment.
